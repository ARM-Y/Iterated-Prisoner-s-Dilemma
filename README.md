# Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

This repository contains a collection of **Python-based strategies** for the **Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma**, which were developed by students for an Artificial Intelligence class exercise. Using a simple game engine, these strategies competed against each other to see which one could earn the most points.

The results from two years of competition are available in the **'results'** directory, and a third year of results will be added next year with the new class.

### Anonymization

The student's names have been anonymized with random names to protect their identity. This process was done using the `Name_Anonymizer.ipynb` file, which you can find at this [link](https://github.com/ARM-Y/Iterated-Prisoner-s-Dilemma/blob/main/Results/Name_Anonymizer.ipynb).

### Winner is not the Harshest!

A key aspect of this tournament is that **total points matter most**. This means that a strategy that wins all its games but gathers few points is considered inferior to a strategy that accumulates a higher total score. This setup is designed to mimic the social and economic environments we live in, where long-term collaboration often yields better results than short-term gains.
