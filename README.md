# Repeated-prisoner-s-dilemma
For one of their Artificial Intelligence class exercises, students developed different strategies and implemented them in Python. Using a simple game engine, also implemented with Python functions, these strategies competed against each other, culminating in a points table that identified the winners.

It must be noted that this was an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. For two years, the results have been provided in two folders within the 'results' directory. A third year will be added next year with the new students of the Artificial Intelligence course.

An important thing to notice is that total points matter. This means that winning all the games but gathering few points is an inferior strategy, mimicking the social and economic environment we live in.
